Ride Sharing after Uber and Lyft is becoming really Popular!
I have been analyzed data for a Ride Sharing Company to look foraward to new opportunities for market differentiation.
The datasets provide information like fares, number of rides and drivers count for many cities.
Analyzing the data provided from the company we can conclude three important conideration:
1. The most evident assumption concluded by looking at the data provided is that, dividing city by city types,
the most popular, from Pyber Ride Sharing prospective, are Urban cities, reaching  always greatly more than 50 % 
over the others.

2. On the contrary we can assume that rural cities are the less popular for this kind of business, reaching really low 
percentage values, in any case under 10 %.

3. Paying attention at the trend of the data mentioned above, and looking at the scatter plot sketched on the analysis,
we can assume that the highest fares are reached by rural cities that also have really low demand of the service, 
and the lowest fares are reached by urban cities that on the contrsry have the highest demand of Ride Sharing.
